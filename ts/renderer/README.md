# Web renderer

Three.js based web renderer for Noice.

## Scripts

- `yarn watch`: Runs the build in watch mode.
- `yarn build`: Creates a production build of the prototype.
- `yarn build:deps`: Builds all dependencies (gets run implicitly by build and watch)
- `yarn serve`: Runs a little node.js server running the prototype output.
- `yarn watch-serve`: Runs `yarn watch` and `yarn serve` in parallel (requires unix/linux).
